= asciidoctor-demo

Demonstrates a problem with the combination of asciidoctorj-diagram and asciidoctorj-pdf.

== Steps to reproduce

1. Clone this repository
1. Run `mvn package`

The build renders the document twice, first as HTML and then as PDF.

== The problem

Here's how the `target` directory looks afterwards:

[code]
----
$ pwd
/home/hho/asciidoctor-demo

$ tree -a target
target
├ .asciidoctor
│   └ diagram
│       └ demo.svg.cache
├ asciidoctor-demo-0.1.pdf
├ home
│   └ hho
│       └ asciidoctor-demo
│           └ target
│               └ .asciidoctor
│                   └ diagram
│                       └ demo.svg.cache
├ images
│   ├ demo.svg
│   └ logo.png
└ index.html

9 directories, 6 files
----

The `demo.svg.cache` gets created twice, and the second time (from the PDF generation) it includes the entire path to
my project.

(I don't really know where to open an issue for it - I think it's asciidoctor-diagram creating the cache file, but the
problem only happens when generating a PDF with asciidoctor-pdf)
